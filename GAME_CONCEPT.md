# Dreamrooms - Game Concept

## Overview
**Dreamrooms** is a first-person atmospheric horror maze game that explores themes of disorientation, isolation, and surreal psychological tension. Players navigate through a dark, procedurally-generated labyrinth armed only with a dim light source, while being pursued by an otherworldly entity.

## Inspiration

The game draws from multiple artistic and cultural influences to create a unique liminal horror experience:

### **Backrooms/Liminal Spaces**
- Endless, monotonous corridors that create a sense of being trapped
- Familiar yet unsettling environments that feel "wrong"
- The uncanny feeling of being in a space that shouldn't exist

### **Dreamcore Aesthetic**
- Surreal, nostalgic imagery that evokes half-remembered dreams
- Soft, warm lighting that contrasts with the dark unknown
- Disorienting spatial logic that mirrors dream experiences
- The boundary between reality and nightmare

### **David Lynch (Twin Peaks, Lost Highway)**
- Mysterious, psychological thriller atmosphere
- Surreal narrative that exists between reality and dream
- Ambient dread and subtle horror
- The feeling that something is fundamentally "off"

### **David Bowie**
- Experimental, avant-garde aesthetics
- Otherworldly, alienating atmosphere
- Art as a transformative, unsettling experience

## Core Themes

### **Isolation**
The player is alone in an endless maze with only a small circle of light for comfort. The darkness presses in from all sides, and the silence is broken only by footsteps and the distant presence of the enemy.

### **Disorientation**
The procedurally-generated maze ensures that each playthrough is different. The limited visibility and similar-looking corridors create confusion and a loss of spatial awareness, mirroring the logic of dreams.

### **Pursuit**
An unseen enemy stalks the player through the maze. Once spotted, the chase begins - a desperate flight through twisting corridors with death always close behind.

### **Liminal Dread**
The game evokes the feeling of being stuck "between" - between waking and sleeping, between safety and danger, between the familiar and the utterly alien.

## Gameplay Philosophy

**Dreamrooms** is not about jump scares or gore. Instead, it cultivates a persistent sense of unease through:

- **Limited perception**: The small cone of light creates constant uncertainty about what lies in the darkness
- **Sound design**: Atmospheric soundtrack and audio cues that reinforce the dreamlike quality
- **Environmental storytelling**: The maze itself tells the story through its oppressive architecture
- **Minimal UI**: No health bars, minimaps, or objective markers - just you, the light, and the maze

## Victory and Defeat

**Victory**: Find the exit before being caught. The maze reveals itself in full light, and haunting outro music plays as credits roll.

**Defeat**: The enemy catches you. The screen fades to semi-transparent black, "GAME OVER" appears in blood red, and death music plays. There is no escape - only the ESC key to exit.

## The Experience

Playing **Dreamrooms** should feel like being trapped inside a half-remembered nightmare - familiar enough to navigate, strange enough to unsettle, and dangerous enough to create genuine tension. Every corner could lead to safety or to the thing that's been following you. Every dead end could be a trap.

The game asks: *What happens when you're lost in a space that exists only in dreams? And what if you're not alone?*
